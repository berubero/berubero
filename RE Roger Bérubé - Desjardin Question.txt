Hello Heather,

Just to make sure.

I can work as a permanent employee as well as another contract, either directly or by another firm ?
Even in the same department ?
That’s what I understand, am I right?

Thank you.
Roger

Hi Roger, 

I hope all is well! I have spoken to the Contract Labour Office and they have confirmed that no 
restrictions exist on your contract restricted you from working with Desjardin’s directly. You have the all 
clear to apply directly to Desjardin. 

Please feel free to reach out should you have any additional questions. 

Thank you,
Heather
